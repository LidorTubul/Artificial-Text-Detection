Binary Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection (Human vs. Machine)
# Artificial Text Detection – Human vs. Machine Classifier

This project focuses on detecting whether a given piece of text was written by a human or generated by a machine. It's a **binary classification** task applied to **multilingual data**, aimed at addressing the growing need for reliable detection of AI-generated content.

## 🧠 Project Overview

With the rise of large language models, distinguishing between human-written and machine-generated text has become increasingly important — for misinformation detection, academic integrity, and platform trust.

This deep learning model is designed to automatically classify text samples into one of two categories:
- **Human-written**
- **Machine-generated**

## 🔍 Dataset

The project uses a multilingual dataset (details are loaded via `load_dataset` from Hugging Face). The data is pre-labeled, and samples are stored in two classes:
- Label `0` = Human
- Label `1` = Machine-generated

The text samples span multiple languages, making the task more realistic and challenging.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Datasets
- NumPy / Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

A feedforward neural network with:
- Embedding layer (via tokenization)
- One or more hidden layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout for regularization
- Sigmoid output for binary classification

> The notebook includes tokenization, padding, batching, and a training loop using Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

## 📊 Evaluation

- **Accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** are reported
- A confusion matrix is plotted
- Loss and accuracy curves over epochs are visualized
- Several text samples and their predictions are displayed for sanity check

## 📎 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install torch datasets scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
    ```

2. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Lidor_Tubul_deep_learning_project.ipynb
    ```

3. Run all cells sequentially. The notebook:
   - Loads and preprocesses the data
   - Builds and trains the model
   - Evaluates and visualizes results

## 📚 Motivation

AI-generated text is becoming harder to detect with the naked eye. This project explores how machine learning itself can be used as a solution, especially when applied to multilingual and mixed-content datasets.
